Handling Missing Values:

Impact on Model Performance: Missing values in the dataset can lead to biased or incomplete analyses, affecting the model's ability to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.
Options for Handling Missing Values:

*Imputation: Fill in missing values with estimated or calculated values (e.g., mean, median, or mode) based on the available data.
*Removal: Remove rows or columns with missing values. This is applicable when the missing values are limited and won't significantly impact the overall dataset.

Handling Duplicate Rows:

Impact on Model Performance: Duplicate rows can introduce bias in the model training process. The model may give more importance to duplicated instances, affecting its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
Options for Handling Duplicate Rows:

*Deduplication: Remove duplicate rows to ensure that each data point is unique. This helps in preventing the model from overfitting to specific instances and improves generalization.

Handling Outliers:

Impact on Model Performance: Outliers, or extreme values, can disproportionately influence model training. They might lead the model to learn patterns based on these extreme values, making it less effective in predicting normal instances.
Options for Handling Outliers:

*Transformation: Apply mathematical transformations (e.g., log transformation) to make the data more normally distributed and reduce the impact of outliers.
*Truncation or Winsorization: Cap or replace extreme values with less extreme values to minimize their impact.
Removal: In some cases, outliers may be removed if they are data entry errors or anomalies that don't represent the underlying patterns
