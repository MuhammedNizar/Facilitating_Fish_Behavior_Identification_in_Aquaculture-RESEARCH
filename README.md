# Fish Disease Identification Using Machine Learning and Water Quality Parameters

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a comprehensive surveillance system for fish disease identification and water quality monitoring using machine learning techniques. The system integrates various technologies including machine learning models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, KNN), IoT devices, image processing, and expert systems to enhance fish health management in aquaculture.

## Features
- Identification of fish species, behaviors, and diseases based on water quality parameters.
- Real-time monitoring of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and other key parameters.
- Early detection of abnormalities or disease outbreaks through machine learning algorithms.
- Integration with mobile applications for disease reporting and real-time alerts to farmers.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, OpenCV (for image processing), Pandas, NumPy
- Raspberry Pi (for IoT device setup)
- VNC Server (for remote access)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fish-disease-identification.git
   cd fish-disease-identification

pip install -r requirements.txt
